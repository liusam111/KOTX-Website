We’re all-inclusive, meaning everyone’s invited! Essentially, we’re a bunch of K-pop nerds who get together and share our love of K-pop. We’re a big, crazy, chaotic, welcoming, friendly family. Others may think we’re weird for liking K-pop, but who cares, we’ve got each other and that’s all that matters.">

                    <h2>What's KOTX?</h2>
                    <p>
                        KOTX is UCSD’s only K-pop community! We’re both a social organization 
                        and an all-inclusive dance team. Our mission is to provide a warm and 
                        welcoming environment for all K-pop fans!

                    <h2>Y'all have events?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes! We have a wide variety of social events which are all meant to be a bonding time 
                        with fellow KOTX members/K-pop fans, and we also host K-pop dance workshops, where we 
                        teach a small portion of K-pop choreographies! To come to the social events and to the 
                        workshops, there’s nothing required! There’s no fee, no sign-ups, no nothing. Just bring 
                        yourself!

                    <h2>What's a KOTX membership?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Everyone is welcome to come to our events, but paid members do have benefits. You’re able 
                        to have first dibs on carpool situations, you get priority on events that can only have a 
                        certain number of people (like karaoke night), you can join the dance team, and you can film 
                        a dance cover. KOTX Staff always promises that your membership fees go back to the members. 
                        There’s no point in having the money if it’s not spent on our members. Also, if you are having 
                        ANY sort of financial difficulties with the fee, please also talk to staff about it, money should 
                        not and will not get in the way of you joining the club.
                    </p>

                            To pay the membership fee, please feel free to come to our events or come to our quarterly 
                            info nights so you can meet with our treasurer and they can assist you. Any other questions

                    <p>
                        We’re not a Korean cultural club, you DO NOT have to be korean to join KOTX.
